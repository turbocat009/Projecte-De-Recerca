# Art Evolution Project – “Evolució de l’Art”

Welcome to the **Art Evolution Project**, a digital space dedicated to exploring the evolution of art, discovering artists, and diving into artworks through time.  
This website (hosted at [projectederecerca.pages.dev](https://projectederecerca.pages.dev/about/)) is a resource built by a group of students at Institut Pau Vila in Sabadell, for a final-year project.

---

## 🎯 Objectives  
- To make it easier and more accessible for everyone to understand how art has evolved over time.  
- To provide a dynamic and interactive platform where visitors can explore artists and artworks.  
- To bridge technology and art education: combining historical context, visual content and modern web design.

Here’s how the site is organised:

- **Art** – The main section where you can browse key art movements and see how styles, techniques, themes and media have changed.  
- **Explora** – An interactive module: search, filter and dive into artworks by era, medium, region, or theme — perfect if you like to wander freely through art history.  
- **Artistes** – A dedicated area to explore profiles of artists: their lives, influences, major works and how they contributed to the evolution of art.  
- **Sobre** – About this project: who created it, the mission, contact details and acknowledgements.
